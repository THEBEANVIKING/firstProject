			  <h1>The Day Bob Destroyed the City</h1>
			  
			  <p>Bob was just a little tiny-tot when he walked into downtown Bigglyville. He was walking through the park when he say the big water tower in the center of the park. He got excited and ran towards it.
			  As he got near it, he tripped on his shoelace because he forgot to tie it and fell on the lever that releases all the water from the tower. 
			  Realizing what he had done he tried to run away, but the huge wave of water caught up to him in seconds and soon the whole town was in ruins from the water.</p>
